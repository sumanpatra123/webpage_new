            <p>1986: A star is born.</p>

            <p>Sushant Singh Rajput was an Indian film and television actor, born to a Rajput family originally from Patna, Bihar. He is best known for his role in sports biopic M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016). Singh was pampered and indulged by his four elder sisters since childhood, Sushant was a fun loving and jovial guy with an emotional core. He defied his parents to follow his dreams of joining the glamour industry, promising to return if things did not work out.</p>

            <p>However, once he started, he had no reasons to look back at all. Sushant turned to dance after he saw a performance by the troupe of choreographer Shiamak Daawar. He joined that troupe and went on to perform in the 2006 Commonwealth Games and Filmfare Awards. Upon his return he also joined Barry John's theatre classes. Moving to Mumbai, Singh danced with Ashley Lobo's troupe, learned martial arts from Allan Amin and assisted Mohit Suri during the making of Raaz 2. He continued his involvement in theatre during this period and was a member of Nadira Babbar's Ekjute theatre group.

            <p>Following a play for a non-governmental organisation, Singh was offered the role of Preet in Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, and the popularity of that led him on to the role of Manav in Pavitra Rishta and projects such as season two of Zara Nachke Dikha and season four of Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa. In Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 4 he was paired with choreographer Shampa Sonthalia and his efforts in the display of many dance forms won him the award of Most Consistent Performer.</p>

            <p>In November 2011, after two and a half years of acting in Pavitra Rishta, Singh left to pursue other projects. Sushant made his film debut in Kai Po Che! (2013), for which he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut.
